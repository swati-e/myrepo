Git and Github 
- git init 
To convert normal folder into git repository (.git folder -> Meta data of git folder). 

- ls 
It shows list of files present in the folder 

- git status 
It gives status of repository

- git clone linkURL folderName
It used to import repository from github to our computer

Life Cycle of a change
1)Committed repository
2)Working directory (temp changes)
3)Staging index (about to commit)

Review a Repo History
- git log    (git log -1 , git log -3)
It shows commits and changes history. Username and date.

- git log -p
It shows details of where the changes made i.e. content which modified.

- git log --online
It only shows commit id and comment 

- git log --stat
Shows which file modified.

How to commit
- git add fileName
To add old file in staging index 
Add new file to track

- git commit -m “msg”

 Git commit -am “msg
Add and commit at a time
- git add .  => used to add all modified filr but it is not recommonded.


If mistakenly we made any change in file and we want to restore the using this command we can restore to Head(the Position where last commit made)
- git restore fileName 

- git diff 
To see what changes have been made 


.gitignore  Folder 
The files which we want to ignore which can add into this folder 
Ex. *.txt  (all files with .txt extension will be ignored)
But we need to commit .gitignore file


Branching, tagging and merging
